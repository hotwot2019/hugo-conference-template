# hugo-conference-template







## Theme templates

A free version of `conference` from uiCookies unnder [Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) with [addition attributes](https://uicookies.com/license/#free-template-attribution).

The footer remains unchanged to cater `You are not allowed to remove the copyright credit from the footer.`

The theme is ported to work with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as the static site generator to build the conference site automatically by injecting data through toml/yaml files (on-going).
