                    HotWoT is a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners interested in the design, implementation, and evaluation of Web of things (WoT) systems and applications. 
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Sponsored by the ACM, the IEEE Computer Society, the workshop seeks to act as a conduit for the presentation of novel approaches used in support of performance, scalability, and security of WoT systems and applications, including technologies to enable seamless integration of physical things,  Web of things searching/indexing/discovery, content distribution and delivery networks, Web of Things services, online social/physical networks, mobile Web, and edge computing. In particular, we aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry working on Web of Things to discuss new ideas in this emerging area. </p>
